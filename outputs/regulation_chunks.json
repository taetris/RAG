    "text": "(61)  Both the Member State s and eu-LISA should maintain secur ity plans in order to facilitate the implementation of \nsecur ity oblig ations and should cooperate with each other in order to address secur ity issues. eu-LIS A should also \nmake sure there is a continuous use of the latest technological developments to ensure data integr ity in the \ncont ext of the development, design and management of the interoperability components. eu-LISA's oblig ations 22.5.2019 L 135/92 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(11)Regulation (EU) 2019/816 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 Apr il 2019 establishing a centralised system for the \nidentification of Member States holding conv iction information on third-countr y nationals and statel ess persons (ECRIS- TCN) to \nsupplement the European Criminal Records Information Syst em and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 (see page 1 of this Offi cial \nJour nal). \n(12)Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the prot ection of individuals with \nregar d to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8, \n12.1.2001, p. 1). \n(13)OJ C 233, 4.7.2018, p. 12.\nin this respect should include adopting the measures necessar y to prevent access by unauthor ised persons, such \nas staff of extern al service providers, to personal data processed through the interoperability compo nents. When \nawar ding contracts for the provi sion of services, the Member States and eu-LISA should consider all measures \nnecessar y to secure compl iance with laws or regulations relating to the prot ection of personal data and to the \nprivacy of individuals or to safeg uard essential secur ity interests, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1046 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council (14) and applicable internati onal conven tions. eu-LISA should apply the \nprinciples of privacy by design and by default during the development of the interoperability components. \n(62)  To suppor t the purposes of statistics and repor ting, it is necessar y to grant access to author ised staff of the \ncompet ent author ities, Union institutions and agencies referred to in this Regulation to consult certain data \nrelat ed to certain interoperability compo nents without enabling the identif ication of individuals. \n(63)  In order to allow Member State author ities and Union agencies to adap t to the new requirements on the use of \nthe ESP, it is necessar y to provid e for a transitional period. Similarly , in order to allow for a coherent and optimal \nfunctioning of the MID, transitional measures should be established for the start of its operations. \n(64)  Since the objective of this Regulation, namely , the establishment of a framew ork for interoperability between EU \ninformation syste ms cannot be suffi ciently achieved by the Member State s but can rather , by reason of the scale \nand effects of the action, be better achi eved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with \nthe principle of subsidiar ity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with \nthe principle of propor tionality , as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessar y \nin order to achieve that objective. \n(65)  The remaining amount in the budget earmark ed for smar t borders in Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the \nEuropean Parliament and the Council (15) should be reallocat ed to this Regulation pursuant to Article 5(5)(b) of \nRegulation (EU) No 515/2014, to cover the costs of the development of the inter operability compo nents. \n(66)  In order to supplement certain detailed technical aspects of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in \naccordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegat ed \nto the Commission in respect of: \n—  extending the transitional period for the use of the ESP; \n—  extending the transitional period for multiple-identity detection carried out by the ETIAS Central Unit; \n—  the procedures for determining the cases where identity data can be considered as the same or similar; \n—  the rules on the operation of the CRRS, including specifi c safeg uards for processing of personal data and the \nsecur ity rules applicable to the repository ; and \n—  detailed rules on the operation of the web portal. \nIt is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropr iate consultations during its preparat ory \nwork, including at exper t level, and that those consultations be conduct ed in accordance with the principles laid \ndown in the Interin stitutional Agreement of 13 Apr il 2016 on Better Law-Mak ing (16). In particular , to ensure \nequal participation in the preparation of delegat ed acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all \ndocuments at the same time as Member State' exper ts, and their exper ts syste matically have access to meetings of \nCommission exper t groups dealing with the preparation of delegat ed acts. \n(67)  In order to ensure unif orm conditions for the imp lementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should \nbe conferred on the Commission to deter mine the dates from which the ESP, the shared BMS, the CIR, the MID \nand the CRRS are to start operations. 22.5.2019 L 135/93 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(14)Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to \nthe general budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No 1296/2013, (EU) No 1301/2013, (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) \nNo 1304/2013, (EU) No 1309/2013, (EU) No 1316/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No 283/2014, and Decision No 541/2014/EU and \nrepealing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (OJ L 193, 30.7.2018, p. 1). \n(15)Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 Apr il 2014 establishing as part of the Internal \nSecur ity Fund, the Instr ument for financial suppor t for exter nal borders and visa and repealing Decision No 574/2007/EC (OJ L 150, \n20.5.2014, p. 143). \n(16)OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1.\n(68)  Implementing powers should also be conferred on the Commission relating to the adopt ion of detailed rules on: \nthe technical details of the ESP user prof iles; the specif ications of the technical solution allowing the EU \ninformation systems, Europol data and Interp ol databases to be quer ied through the ESP and the format of the \nESP's replies; the technical rules for creating link s in the MID between data from different EU information \nsystem s; the content and presentation of the form to be used to inform the data subject when a red link is \ncreat ed; the performa nce requirements and performa nce monitori ng of the shared BMS; automat ed data quality \ncontrol mec hanisms, procedures and indicator s; the development of the UMF standard; the cooperation \nprocedure to be used in the case of a secur ity incident ; and the specif ications of the technical solution for \nMember States to manage users access requests. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation \n(EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17). \n(69)  As the interoperability components will involve the processing of signif icant amounts of sensitive personal data, \nit is important that persons whose data are processed through those compo nents can effectively exercise their \nrights as data subjects as required under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation \n(EU) 2018/1725. The data subjects should be provided with a web portal that facilitates their exercise of their \nrights of access to, rectification, erasure and restr iction of processing of their personal data. eu-LISA should \nestablish and manag e such a web portal. \n(70)  One of the core principles of data prot ection is data minimisation: under Article 5(1)(c) of Regulation \n(EU) 2016/679, the processing of personal data must be adequat e, relevant and limited to what is necessar y in \nrelation to the purposes for which they are processed. For this reason, the inter operability compo nents should \nnot provid e for the storage of any new personal data, with the exce ption of the link s whic h will be store d in the \nMID and which are the minimum necessar y for the purposes of this Regulation. \n(71)  This Regulation should contain clear provisions on liability and the right to compen sation for unla wful \nprocessing of personal data and for any other act incompatible with it. Such provi sions should be without \nprejudice to the right to compen sation from, and liability of the controller or processor under Regulation \n(EU) 2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. eu-LISA should be responsible for any \ndamage it causes in its capacity as a data processor where it has not complied with the oblig ations specifically \nimposed on it by this Regulation, or where it has acted outside or contrar y to lawful instr uctions of the \nMember State which is the data controller \n(72)  This Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and \nof the Council (18). \n(73)  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexe d to the TEU and to \nthe TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its \napplication. Given that this Regulation, insof ar as its provisions relat e to SIS as govern ed by Regulation \n(EU) 2018/1862, builds upon the Sche ngen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol , \ndecide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement \nit in its national law. \n(74)  Insof ar as its provis ions relate to SIS as govern ed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1862, the United Kingdom is taking \npart in this Regulation, in accordance with Article 5(1) of Protocol No 19 on the Scheng en acquis integrat ed into \nthe framew ork of the European Union, annexe d to the TEU and to the TFEU and Article 8(2) of Council \nDecision 2000/365/EC (19). Further more, insofa r as its provisions relate to Eurodac and to ECRIS- TCN, in \naccordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the \narea of freedom, secur ity and justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, the Unit ed Kingdom has notifi ed, by \nlette r of 18 May 2018, its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation. 22.5.2019 L 135/94 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(17)Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 Febr uary 2011 laying down the rules and general \nprinciples concer ning mec hanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, \n28.2.2011, p. 13). \n(18)Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 Apr il 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their \nfami ly members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and \nrepealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and \n93/96/EEC (OJ L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 77). \n(19)Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concer ning the request of the Unit ed Kingdom of Great Britain and Nor ther n Ireland to \ntake part in some of the provisions of the Scheng en acquis (OJ L 131, 1.6.2000, p. 43).\n(75)  Insof ar as its provi sions relate to SIS as govern ed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1862, Ireland could, in principle, take \npart in this Regulation, in accordance with Article 5(1) of Protocol No 19 on the Scheng en acquis integrat ed into \nthe framew ork of the European Union, annexe d to the TEU and to the TFEU, and Article 6(2) of Council \nDecision 2002/192/EC (20). Further more, insofa r as its provisions relate to Eurodac and to ECRIS- TCN, in \naccordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in \nrespect of the area of freedom, secur ity and justice, annexed to the TEU and the TFEU, and without prejudice to \nArticle 4 of that Prot ocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adop tion of this Regulation and is not bound by it or \nsubject to its application. Since it is not possible, under these circumstances, to ensure that this Regulation is \napplicable in its entirety to Ireland, as required by Article 288 of the TFEU, Ireland is not taking part in the \nadopt ion of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application, without prejudice to its rights \nunder Protocol s No 19 and No 21. \n(76)  As regar ds Iceland and Nor way, this Regulation constitute s, insof ar as it relates to SIS as governed by Regulation \n(EU) 2018/1862, a development of the provisions of the Scheng en acquis within the meaning of the Agreement \nconcluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Nor way \nconcer ning the latter s' association with the implementation, application and development of the Scheng en \nacquis (21) whic h fall within the area refer red to in Article 1, point G of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (22). \n(77)  As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitut es insof ar as it relat es to SIS as governed by Regulation \n(EU) 2018/1862, a development of the provisions of the Scheng en acquis within the meaning of the Agreement \nbetween the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Conf edera ­\ntion's association with the imple mentation, application and development of the Scheng en acquis (23) which fall \nwithin the area referred to in Article 1, point G of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of \nCouncil Decision 2008/149/JHA (24). \n(78)  As regar ds Liecht enstei n, this Regulation constitutes insofa r as it relat es to SIS as govern ed by Regulation \n(EU) 2018/1862, a development of the provisions of the Scheng en acquis within the meaning of the Protocol \nbetween the European Union, the European Community , the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of \nLiecht enste in on the accession of the Principality of Liecht enstei n to the Agreement between the European Union, \nthe European Community and the Swiss Confederati on on the Swiss Conf ederation's association with the \nimplementation, application and development of the Scheng en acquis (25) which fall within the area referred \nto in Article 1, point G of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council \nDecision 2011/350/EU (26). \n(79)  This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and obser ves the principles recognised in particular by the \nChar ter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and should be applied in accordance with those rights and \nprinciples. \n(80)  In order to have this Regulation fit into the existing legal framewor k, Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council (27) and Regulations (EU) 2018/1862 and (EU) 2019/816 should be \namended according ly, 22.5.2019 L 135/95 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN     \n(20)Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 Febr uary 2002 concer ning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the \nSchengen acquis (OJ L 64, 7.3.2002, p. 20). \n(21)OJ L 176, 10.7.1999, p. 36. \n(22)Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrang ements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the \nCouncil of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Nor way concer ning the association of those two States \nwith the implementation, application and development of the Scheng en acquis (OJ L 176, 10.7.1999, p. 31). \n(23)OJ L 53, 27.2.2008, p. 52. \n(24)Council Decision 2008/149/JHA of 28 Januar y 2008 on the conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the Agreement between the \nEuropean Union, the European Community and the Swiss Conf ederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implemen ­\ntation, application and development of the Scheng en acquis (OJ L 53, 27.2.2008, p. 50). \n(25)OJ L 160, 18.6.2011, p. 21. \n(26)Council Decision 2011/350/EU of 7 March 2011 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the Protocol between the \nEuropean Union, the European Community , the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liecht enstein on the accession of the \nPrincipality of Liecht enstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on \nthe Swiss Confederation's association with the implementa tion, application and development of the Schengen acquis, relating to the \nabolition of checks at internal borders and movement of persons (OJ L 160, 18.6.2011, p. 19). \n(27)Regulation (EU) 2018/1726 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on the European Union Agen cy for \nthe Operational Management of Larg e-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Secur ity and Justice (eu-LISA) , and amending \nRegulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Council Decision 2007/533/JHA and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 (OJ L 295, \n21.11.2018, p. 99).\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGUL ATION: \nCHAPTER I \nGeneral provisions",
